The article and the lecture deal with increasing sea level over the past decades. While the article calls this a ‘normal’ process and that there is nothing much to worry about this as humanity will have enough time to acclimatise themselves, the lecturer stands in direct contraditction of this, clearly describing this as an unnatural process which would result in drastic changes, not permitting enough time for the mankind to adjust.

To begin with, the reading claims that analysis of the data and in-depth study of the matter renders this evident that the increase in sea level is a natural process, which one should not be alarmed about. However, the professor contradicts this asserting that there is ‘no doubt’ that this process is not a natural phenomenon and that human activity is responsible for it. Over the years, humans have burned fossil fuels without restraint, leading to the greenhouse effect which has resulted in increase in permafrost melting that would under ordinary circumstances have taken 10,000 years to take place. This is 100 times faster than the present rate and hence abnormal.  

Next, while the author claims that there is no consensus about the source for the additional water causing the rise in sea level even among scientific agencies such as the NASA, the lecturer stands in direct contradiction of this maintaining that the source is already accounted for which is the melting of permafrost, ice present on lands which usually never melts. She argues that since this ice is already not present in the ocean like the polar ice, its melting results in an addition to the water in the ocean. To illustrate this, she provides the example of Greenland in northern Siberia where this has happened. She also states that the NASA has already accounted for this connection and that the only unknown is the process through which this occurs.

Thus, the speaker refutes the claim that humans will not have time to adjust to the dramatic shift caused due to increase in sea level. And it is high time that an action should be taken, else the day is not far when 20% of the landforms will submerge under water. And the first to submerge would be the places that are located on or near the oceans.
